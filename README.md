**üè° House Price Prediction using Regression**

A Machine Learning Project

This project involves predicting house prices using regression techniques. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can estimate house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of rooms, location, and other relevant factors.

**üìå Project Overview**

The project uses historical house data to predict future house prices. The dataset includes various features such as house size, location, number of rooms, and year of construction. Regression models, particularly Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression, were used to predict the target variable, i.e., house price.

**üõ† Technologies Used**

Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn

Tools: Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts
**üìÇ Dataset**

Source: Kaggle Dataset
Description: The dataset contains details about different houses, including the features used to predict house prices.
Key Columns:
SquareFeet: Area of the house in square feet
NumRooms: Number of rooms in the house
Location: The location of the property
Age: The age of the house
Price: Target variable, the price of the house 

**üìà Process Workflow**

Data Loading & Understanding:

Load the dataset using Pandas and perform initial exploration to understand its structure.
Inspect missing values, data types, and statistics.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, if any (e.g., using mean/median imputation).
Convert categorical variables (e.g., Location) into numerical form using encoding techniques.
Scale numerical features to bring them to a comparable scale.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize key features (scatter plots, histograms, etc.).
Investigate correlations between features and target variable (Price).
Model Building:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train multiple regression models, such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression.
Tune the model‚Äôs hyperparameters for optimal performance.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the performance of models using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Compare model performance and select the best-performing model.
Prediction & Visualization:

Make predictions on the test dataset.
Visualize the predicted prices against the actual prices using scatter plots or other suitable graphs.
